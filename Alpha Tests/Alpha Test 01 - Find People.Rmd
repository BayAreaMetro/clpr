## Administration

### Purpose
Examine a month of the anonymized Clipper data to try and find rare, but persistent, patterns, that may allow a third-party consumer of the data to identify individual travelers.  This is part of the pre-release anonymized Clipper data alpha testing.

### Status
2014 08 08 seems to be working

### Outputs
1 Simple Shiny tables of rare and common sequences.

## Procedure

#### Overhead

```{r overhead}
library(knitr)
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressMessages(library(plyr))
library(shiny)
setwd("M:/Data/Clipper/Alpha Tests/_working")
```

```{r config, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

#### Read in the sequence data

```{r data_reads}
#input.seq = read.table(file = "./Sequence Frequencies by Date.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
input.seq = read.table(file = "M:/Data/Clipper/Alpha Tests/_working/Sequence Frequencies by Date.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(input.seq, n =10)
```

#### Explore typical weekdays
```{r typical_weekdays}
seq.typical <- mutate(input.seq, CircadianDayOfWeek = weekdays(as.Date(input.seq$CircadianDate)))
seq.typical <- filter(seq.typical, CircadianDayOfWeek == "Tuesday" | CircadianDayOfWeek == "Wednesday" |CircadianDayOfWeek == "Thursday")
seq.typical <- select(seq.typical, CircadianDate, RunSequence, Count = n)
seq.sum <- ddply (seq.typical, .(RunSequence), summarise, SumFreq = sum(Count), MedianFreq = median(Count), MinFreq = min(Count), MaxFreq = max(Count))

```

##### Every typical weekday sequences
```{r every_typical}
every.typical <- tally(group_by(seq.typical, RunSequence), wt = NULL, sort = TRUE)
every.typical <- filter(every.typical, n == length(unique(seq.typical$CircadianDate)))
every.typical <- select(every.typical, -n)
every.seq <- left_join(x = every.typical, y = seq.sum, by = "RunSequence")
every.seq <- select(every.seq, -SumFreq)
every.seq <- arrange(every.seq, desc(MedianFreq))
```

#### Rare, but everyday, typical weekday sequences
```{r rare_typical}
rare.typical <- filter(every.seq, (MinFreq == 1) & (MaxFreq == 1))
rare.typical <- select(rare.typical, RunSequence, MinFreq, MaxFreq)
```

##### Select rare sequences
```{r rare_typical_shiny, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
numericInput("rows", "How many rows would you like to see?", 50)
renderTable({head(rare.typical, input$rows)})
```

#### Common, everyday, typical weekday sequences
```{r common_typical}
common.typical <- filter(every.seq, percent_rank(MedianFreq) > 0.95)
common.typical <- arrange(common.typical, desc(MedianFreq))
```

#### Select common sequences
```{r common_typical_shiny, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
#numericInput("rows", "How many rows would you like to see?", 50)
#renderTable({head(common.typical, input$rows)})
```


#### Show sequences that contain ...
```{r common_typical_string_shiny, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
textInput("Contains", "Route sequence contains:", "TYPE HERE")
renderTable({head(filter(every.seq, grepl(input$Contains,every.seq$RunSequence)), 50)})
```
