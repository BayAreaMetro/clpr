## Goal 

For product string balues, this is a very rough draft of those that have a 'less than cash' ticket price. 

## Why

These values could potentially be used to understand usage and used in [travel model analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Data-And-Visualization-Projects/tree/a882743ac0f8db750d199dc6c634de2501590ebf/clipper-institutional-cards)
