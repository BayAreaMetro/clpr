anonymous-clipper/Transfers
=================

To help validate the MTC travel model, here we summarize successive movements made by a single Clipper card within [pre-defined time windows](transfer_rules_database.csv).  We refer to these as transfers.  The scripts here [extract the data from the anonymous Clipper database](Extract Transfer for Random Weekday to CSV.R), [create interactive pair-wise by tag time difference plots](To and From Interactive.Rmd), and [build a database of transfer summaries](Build Transfer Database.Rmd).  The resulting data is summarized in Tableau [here](http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/Main/ClipperTransfers).
